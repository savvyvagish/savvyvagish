# Hi, I’m Vagish Shandilya 👋

I like understanding how things work — software, systems, servers, and the internet itself.

Some days I’m building an app,    
some days I’m setting up servers or domains,
some days I’m messing with Linux.

I’m not focused on one path right now — just exploring, breaking things, fixing them, and learning along the way.


## Projects

- **TheNotepad**  
  A minimalist desktop text editor built with Electron.

- **Python Browser**  
  A small experimental web browser built using Python.

Most of my work is learning-driven — small projects, setups, and experiments.

Still learning. Still experimenting.
